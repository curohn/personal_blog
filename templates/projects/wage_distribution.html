        <progress value="60" max="100"></progress> 60%
        <p>This project explores the income distribution of households across different income groups using <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2020.S1901?q=S1901">census data</a>.   </p>

        <h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
        <p>This project was aimed at being a demonstration of an exploratory data analysis. Starting with data and a question, ending with deeper understanding into the data and what it shows. It&#39;s written like a story from the first person perspective, in order to show my methodology and thought process into the analysis. While this writeup can give you the basics, I&#39;d highly recommend reading the whole notebook available on <a href="https://github.com/curohn/wage_distribution">github.</a></p>

        <h2 id="design">Design</h2>
        <p>This project is set up in a single jupyter notebook. Intaking data, preprocessing and cleaning, and providing results. </p>

        <h3 id="data-preparation">Data Preparation</h3>
        <p>The data was sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau and contains household income estimates categorized by income brackets for different years. Key steps in preparing the data include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cleaning:
                <ul>
                    <li>Removed symbols such as %, Â±, and commas to ensure numerical consistency.</li>
                    <li>Filtered out rows with missing or invalid data in the households_estimate column.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Data Filtering:
                <ul>
                    <li>Focused the analysis on the year 2010 for simplicity and clarity.</li>
                    <li>Removed rows with non-positive values in households_estimate.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensuring Validity:</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Verified that each income group contained valid numeric data to avoid empty groups in the visualization.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
        <p>This project is currently in progress, and just plots the distributions over time. Future enhancements will be added.</p>

        <h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>
        <p>This analysis can be extended by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comparing and measuring income distributions across multiple years to identify trends.</li>
            <li>Measuring spread of distributions within, and across years.</li>
            <li>Expanding the visualization to include additional household categories (e.g., families, nonfamily households).</li>
        </ul>
